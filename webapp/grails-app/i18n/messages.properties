Once the requirement is added it can be seen on the panel at left hand side of the screen.
index.viewRequirements=Viewing requirements
index.requirementsInTheLeft=Requirements in the left panel are ordered by their priority. The most critical requirements are shown first and more minor ones last. By default, the longer descriptions of the requirements are collapsed and only the title is shown, but the rest of the information can be brought into view and collapsed again using the collapse button on the left side of the title. Hovering your mouse over the requirement shows its description over the site view at the spot where it was attached and clicking leaves the floating description visible.

index.reportView=Viewing a report of requirements
index.theReportView=The Report View shows a summary of all the pages that have requirements attached to them and also lists said requirements. To help the user to get a quick idea of which requirements are resolved, these titles are marked with a strike-out.

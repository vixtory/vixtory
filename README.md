## News

### January 28th, 2009 Vixtory is now open source!

We are proud to announce that Vixtory has now been open sourced under the MIT License. A project long in the making, the source code can now be found and checked out in Google Code. Issue tracking and documentation space are not yet open to public. This is, however, subject to change, should our project be accepted for hosting at codehaus.org.

While this is still not an actual release (hence no downloadable install packages yet), it is nevertheless fantastic news for the project. Thanks to everyone involved! We are busy working on making the tool more stable as well as introducing improvements to user interface and functionality. If everything goes as planned, we should have our first release somewhere in Q2/2009.

### December 2nd, 2008 AgileTool is now Vixtory

Hello from the folks at Ambientia! We decided to release AgileTool as an open source product. We thought this as a good point to change the product name to reflect the product idea better.

It takes some time to prepare all the necessary infrastructure. We are expecting to get the first open source release done during the January/February 2009. Stay tuned for more information!
